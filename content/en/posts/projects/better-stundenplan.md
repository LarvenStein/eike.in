## Short Description
Better Stundenplan was created as part of a school project in which we were tasked with developing an Android app.

Better Stundenplan provides an improved frontend for our school's "[virtual timetable](https://virtueller-stundenplan.org/)", which (in my opinion) is barely usable.

### Features
* **Weekly View**: Displays the timetable for the entire week.
* **Daily View**: Shows the schedule for a single day.
* **Detail View**: Displays detailed information about each lesson.
    * Allows aliases for subjects, teachers, and rooms.

## Technologies
I chose `Flutter` for this project because I had already gained experience with it in a previous project.  
Additionally, `Flutter` allows me to build the app for multiple platforms.
